# Calculator 

## Description 

Java swing desktop Calculator

## How to use

Application calculates users input with basic operations, resolves equations in brackets and adheres to priority operators ( * or / first).
I've implemented useful "modulo" and "round" function which works with simple equations. Scientific methods wasn't implemented and "sqrt" operation wasn't finished because of no motivation to continue.
